## Testing React Components With Jest and Enzyme

This is part of the tutorial series on testing React components using Jest and Enzyme. You can read the tutorial series at TutsPlus under the same title. The series is divided into two parts. Hence, the branches here are structured in a similar way. 

The `part-one` branch comprises the application that we'll be testing. You won't find any actual tests there though. 

`part-two` is the starting point of the second part of the series with just a couple of tests written. The tests are written using ReactTestUtils which isn't a great option in my opinion. 

In `part-two-final` we'll be writing a lot more tests and rewriting the existing ones using Enzyme.
